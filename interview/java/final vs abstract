final vs abstract:
---------------------------
1. abstract methods should be overridden in the child classes to provide implementation. But final methods cannot be overridden.
abstract and final combination is illegal for methods.

Test.java:3: error: illegal combination of modifiers: abstract and final
        public abstract final void m1();


2. For abstract class, we should create child classes to provide implementation. But for final classes we cannot create child classes.
Hence abstract and final combination is illegal for classes also.

Test.java:1: error: illegal combination of modifiers: abstract and final
abstract final class Test


3. Abstract class can contain final methods.

4. Final class cannot contain abstract method.
Test.java:1: error: Test is not abstract and does not override abstract method m2() in Test
