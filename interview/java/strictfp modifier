strictfp modifier

introduced in java 1.2 version

strictfp === strict floating point

applicable for classes and methods but not for variables.

The result of floating point arithmetic is varied from platform to platform

windows-- 3.3333333333333335
linux --- 3.3333333
MAC ----  3.3333333333334

If we want platform independent results for floating point arithmetic
strictfp modifier.

strictfp method:
---------------
If a method declared as strictfp then all floating point calculations in that method has to follow IEEE 754 standard, so that we will get platform independent results.

windows-- 3.33333
linux --- 3.33333
MAC ----  3.33333

strictfp class:
---------------
If a class declared as strictfp all concrete methods in that class has to follow IEEE 754 standard, so that we will get platform independent results for floating point arithmetic.


abstract vs strictfp:
--------------------
1. abstract method should not contain implementation. strictfp method should compulsory contains implementation.

abstract-strictfp is illegal for methods.
like abstract-final 

2. abstract-strictfp is legal for classes.
